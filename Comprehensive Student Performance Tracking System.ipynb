        "The Comprehensive Student Performance Tracking System is a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage student academic records. Using SQLite as the database, the system enables users to store, retrieve, update, and delete student performance data, ensuring a structured approach to monitoring academic progress. It employs object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to handle student information dynamically.\n",
        "The system allows users to input student names and scores in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. It then automatically calculates the total marks, average score, and assigns a grade based on a predefined grading system. The system provides a menu-driven interface, making it user-friendly and interactive.\n",
        "This project serves as an efficient tool for educational institutions, reducing manual errors and enhancing performance tracking. It is scalable and extendable, with potential enhancements such as data visualization and predictive analytics. The system provides an automated, structured, and data-driven approach to student assessment, improving academic record management.\n",
